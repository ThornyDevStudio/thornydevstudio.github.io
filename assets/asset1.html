    <h1>Runtime Debugger Toolkit</h1>
    <img src="../images/Cover_Image.png" alt="Asset 1 Cover" style="max-width:100%;">
    <p>Runtime Debugger Toolkit is a modular suite for Unity developers, featuring four tools to simplify runtime debugging and enhance your development workflow.
Collider Visualizer – View 2D/3D colliders directly in your game.
In-Game Console – See logs, warnings, and errors live in both editor and build.
FPS Tracker – Monitor performance and system stats with real-time graphs.
Time Scaler – Adjust simulation speed for testing and optimization.
These tools are fully customizable and accessible via draggable UI panels. You can toggle features individually and adapt their look or behavior through exposed variables in the Inspector.
Perfect for any project genre — from prototypes to full games — and compatible with Built-in, URP, and partially HDRP (except the collider visualizer).
Includes a demo scene and support for Unity's Starter Assets, making it easy to get started.</p>
